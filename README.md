âœ¨ Inspiration

We saw a critical gap in a market filled with generic information. Existing tools offer one-size-fits-all data, failing to provide the personalized insights users truly need. CulturaX was created to fill this void, combining consumer insights with generative AI to help people make smarter decisions.
ðŸ’¡ Features

    Personalized Insights: Tailors consumer insights by analyzing user queries.

    Dynamic Response Generation: Leverages the Gemini API to generate context-aware, human-like responses.

    Intuitive Interface: Built on Streamlit for a simple and user-friendly chat experience.

    Secure API Handling: Integrates with st.secrets to ensure API keys are never exposed.

ðŸš§ Challenges and Learnings

    Challenge: Seamlessly integrating the Gemini API and ensuring that its responses were consistently relevant and informed by the mock consumer insights.

    Solution: We addressed this by carefully crafting the prompt to the Gemini model, explicitly instructing it to act as an expert marketing analyst and to use the provided insights as its primary source of truth.

    Learning: This project reinforced the critical importance of prompt engineering and structured data handling when building AI-powered applications.
